# Mission
Crowdsourcing feedback to help increase product satisfaction

# Problem statement

1. Companies value Voice of Customer (VoC) but user feedback is fragmented and unstructured

2. Products are iterated with little understanding of actual user pain points or wants.


3. Users feel unempowered and that their voice is not important to companies.

# About us
mendit.io is a feedback platform that empowers users to provide structured and actionable feedback.

We believe in the power of crowdsourcing feedback, and understand that it's not easy for users to share their experiences with companies. If users don't feel empowered, they're less likely to participate in the conversation, and their voice becomes lost in the noise.

Users can use Mendit as a place to post feature requests, learn what others think of it, as well as have their feedback be seen by the people working on it.

Our mission is to create a space where users are encouraged to share their thoughts on products to help increase product satisfaction.
